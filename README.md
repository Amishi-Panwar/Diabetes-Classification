Diabetes Classification
What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when our blood glucose goes too high. Blood glucose is our main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells causes diabetes.

Objective
The objective of the project is to diagnostically predict whether patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
This program builds a classifier for Pima Indians Diabetes dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database. It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:

1) Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

2) Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

3) BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

4) SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

5) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

6) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function

8) Age: Age (years)

9) Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0

Phases of the project
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Model Selection
4. Model Parameter Tuning
5. Evaluation
6. Conclusion
